#### Abstract

We present a sports prediction model that predicts the winning team and average margin of victory in NCAA football games. 
Our goal is to analyse the performance all games played by both the teams playing current match and predict the winning 
probability of each team in the current game using those statistics. 

We consider various data features (like points scored by a team against all teams, goal attempts, penalty etc) of each team 
that primarily influence the result of a game and use them in various data models to improve the accuracy of prediction. 
Along with the winning probability, our model also predicts the average margin victory in the current game using appropriate 
data features. 
We used cbstats.com dataset containing information on College Football Statistics from 2005 to 2013 for this analysis and 
prediction model.
